# Interim Classifier Update and Recommendations

Due to the recent rule changes, all classifiers for Limited-10 division were put into temporary
provisional mode, effective Jan 31st.

## Key Information

- Limited-10 division classifiers are in provisional status
- A reviewed shortlist of classifiers is guaranteed active through January 31st, 2026
- All current classifiers remain active in other divisions
- Future plans include optimizing total classifier count from current 100 to 50-60

## Recommended Classifier List

To speed up the process of reactivating Limited-10 classifiers and to prevent any fees being paid on
classifiers that will be retired later this year, we (the USPSA Classifier Committee) recommend the
following classifiers. These have been reviewed and are guaranteed to stay active for all divisions
at least until January 31st 2026.

All classifiers on this list (including 23- and 24-series) will count for Limited-10 classification
purposes once the new High Hit Factors (HHFs) are ready. We hope that this encourages more shooters
to shoot and classify in the newly updated Limited-10 division.

## Current Status and Future Changes

We are not pruning anything right now; all classifiers (except in the Limited-10 division) stay
active, and any changes to them must go through a Board of Director's (BOD) vote first. However, in
anticipation of the first iteration of changes to the USPSA Classification System, we would like to
make a promise to keep a shorter list of classifiers, ensuring that people who shoot low
participation divisions will have enough classifiers to shoot between now and first pruning.

Currently, from the data-collecting standpoint, we have too many divisions and classifiers (9 x
100), making data collection and High Hit Factor calculation for newly introduced changes
(Production, Limited-10) slow. To speed it up, we want to reduce the total number of classifiers to
around 50-60, pending BOD vote, during the first set of changes to the USPSA Classification System.

Like before, the USPSA Classifier Committee will monitor and update the active classifiers list and
HHFs from time to time, keeping the best classifiers in, adding new ones and retiring bad and
unpopular ones. We believe that Classifiers and HHFs are living documents and should keep evolving
with the sport.

## Technical Notes

- HHF: High Hit Factor, the benchmark score used for classification calculations
- Statistical analysis is being applied to existing classification brackets
- New HHFs are calibrated to set relative difficulty equal for all stages regardless of division

## Classifier Committee Mission

The mission of the Classifier Committee is to develop a standardized method of calculating
classification that accurately reflects members' skill levels using mathematically robust
statistical methods, which eliminates subjectivity and bias from the process and makes it 100%
data-driven.

The committee's first priority was to recalculate the High Hit Factors for the 23 and 24 series
classifiers, which were identified as poorly calibrated. With the help of Elo rating correlation and
statistical analysis of existing classification brackets, we found a way to calibrate the system
with new HHFs to set the relative difficulty equal for all stages regardless of the division.
